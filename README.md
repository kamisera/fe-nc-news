# NewsHub

NewsHub is a front-end React application that serves news articles from a [back-end API](https://github.com/kamisera/be-nc-news) built with Node.js and Express. It allows users to read articles, vote on them, add or delete comments and filter by topic.

The application was built with a variety of packages, most notably React, Vite and Axios. Styling was built mostly on Bootstrap v5.

A live version of the app can be seen [here](https://newshub-online.netlify.app/).
